        <span class="text__main">Grom was young for a chieftain, only a few years older than Durotan and Orgrim. There had been mutterings about the mysterious circumstances under which the former chieftain had died, but the Warsong clan did not challenge Grom's leadership. Upon his ascension to chieftainship, Grom's jaw had been ritually tattooed a uniform shade of black.At some point, Grom's mate Golka, bore him a son, Garrosh, though the exact date of his birth is unknown. After contacting the red pox young Garrosh was sent to live in Garadar, and Grom would never see him again.
                Around 11 years  later, Grommash led aggressive raids deep into ogre lands. When the ogres retaliated, they nearly destroyed the Warsong clan. Golka was critically injured during the battle and pleaded with him to finish her off. Disgusted at her weakness in calling for death instead of striving to live, Grom called her "a wolf with no teeth" and walked away, leaving her to suffer. He was similarly disgusted by the weakness of his other warriors who had "bent like weeds." In truth, however, he simply lacked the strength to take the life of the one he loved, and this weakness gnawed at his heart for years to come.
                Grom quickly called upon his forces to hunt down the ogre raiders. However, it was a trap set by the ogre warlord and Grom was captured. The ogre warlord tried to break Grom's spirit by strapping him to a tree and taunting him over the course of many days. While his body withered and became emaciated, Grom's will never wavered. Declaring that "this wolf still has teeth," he finally bit and killed the ogre warlord when he came too close. Grom returned to lead the Warsong clan as "the Warlord with the Iron Will."
                Grommash later had the tree transported to Grommashar to serve as his throne, hanging the head of his ogre tormentor from it.
